1. What are the benefits of using Object-oriented Languages
1.Simple to understand
2. Less complexity
3. Faster developemt
4.Code resusiblity
---------------------------------
2. What are the Memory Allocation available in java ?

These are the following ma in java -
1. Stack ma
2.heap
 ------------------------------
3. Difference between JDK, JRE and JVM
jdk 
1.Java developement kit
2.The is the developemnt enviroment for java programe.
3.Contais jre and jvm
JRE-
1. Java runtime eniveroment 
2. Provides the eniro..for execution for java code
2.the part of jdk
JVM-
1. Java virtual machine
2. Does the actual execution of the java code.
3.It is a programe in itself and heart of JDK
------------------------------------------------
4. Why is java platform independent?
compiler - converts .Java file into .clss file(byte code) 

(high level language into machine language)

Jvm - converts byte code into native executable code

it just need the java enviroment to do this
--------------------------------------------
5. Why is Java not completely object-oriented?
1. Primitive data in java are not inside any class
(need 5 criteria for a programe to be a an OOP's)
as all its objects can ' t transfered throght object 
creation(primitives are there). Hence , Java is not 100% OOP's 
programe.
----------------------------------------------------------
6. Can we overload a static method?
Yes we can!
f(int a)
f(String s)
f(double a)
f(long a)
f(byte a)
f(boolean a)
etc--
---------------------------------------
7. Is it possible to use static keywords with classes.If yes demonstrate
where and how
we can't bcz then we can't create the object of that class and if it happens 
then we are not using the class as a class and its propeties
----------------------------------------
8. Define Wrapper Classes in Java.Why are wrapper classes used when
there are already primitive data types.

To pass the primitive data in the form of object we use Wraper classes
as it was not before in java 
the fully qulified name of primitive data type with class naming convention
int Intger
char Charecter
byte Byte
etc---
------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------
9. What happens when the main() isn't declared as static?

1. Programe is not going to be called even before the object 
creation
2.It will show the run time error that main method is not called
-----------------------------------
10. Will the program run if we write static public void main() instead of
public static void main()?
Yes it will for sure! just the interchaning of the excess modifiers and keyword(static/non-static)
is not gona change the behaviour of the main method in java programe.
