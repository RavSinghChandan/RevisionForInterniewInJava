deatils we have in our talbes, we go for joins
These are the followings JOIN commands
1.JOIN(INNE JOIN)(default)(commmon among the talbes)
2. Left join(left table to join + common among all tables)
3.right join(right talbe to join clause + common among all the tables)
4. outer join(fully outer jion)(left tables in join clause + ringt table in join clause)

Q2.How would you write a query to JOIN these two tables?
To get the relevant information about the entities us use in the tables
let we have two tables say- cutommer and account having different fields.

Who owns each account in the account table?
How many accounts does Marc Tesco have ?
How many accounts are owned by a female customer?
What is the total overdraft amount for all of Emma Johnsonâ€™s accounts?
 such informations we can get from the join clause.

inner join-
The output of this join clause is the common column and matching data 
among two or more talbes.
