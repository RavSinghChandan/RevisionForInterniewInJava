Pick your brain Questions ( 5)
1. If you won a Rs.10-crore lottery, would you still work?

Yes I would still work with more 10 times more compassion, energy and empathy.
  
I would adopt 1000 girls(1 lakh each) from across the India and the world and fund their education

This will change the life of 1000* (f)*(m)
where f = Number of fimily effected in case of girl f =2;
And m = Number of memebers in the family.

On an average I can uplift the life of =
