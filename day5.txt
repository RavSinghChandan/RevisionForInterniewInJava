Q1 What is the difference between Checked and Unchecked
Exceptions in Java, create a user-defined checked and unchecked
exception class?
check exception =
All throwable class except error and runtime exception of exception class
Unchecked exception-
all Runtime exception 
(ame,nullpe,nobe,iobe)
 Yes we can but we have extend the runtime exception for unchekced exception
and exception class for checked exception(except rte)

=========================
Q2 What is the difference between the throw and throws keyword in
Java?

throw
manually throws the exeption and we have to cath this in cath block.
it is in method body or in a block
it only throws only one exception
throws-
It is used when method might throw the exception 
it is used in the method signature i
it is the resposiblity of the caller the handdle this exception
we can throw many exceptiona with throws keyword
=================================
Q3 Explain internal working of HashMap?

Step-1
takes the vlaue from the user and generates the Hash values(but the index ) 
step2-
Puts this hash value into the stack(coloum) as a key 
step-3
Once again when user puts the value(It might be same or different)
step-3 A
if the value if same then it calls the equals method to check weather the 
content is same or not ?
As it is the same so it will generate the same hash value(same) 
and to store this value Java uses first the linked hashmap and if the values
exceeds to 8 it automatically arrange itself into to slef balancing binary tree
 so that the time comlexity of the retreaival will reamain O(1)
Step3 B-
If the value is different it generates different index and placed in the different 
stack ..
===============================
Explain internal working of HashSet?
same as hashmap 
==================
Q5 What is the difference between "==" and equals() method in
Java?
]== 
compares the referene of the object
equals ()
cheks the content of the two object
======================
Q7 Why do we need to override equals and hashcode method?
To avoid the hash collion
so that hash algorith don' t generate the same hash code 
========================
Q9 Explain Finally and Final Keyword with an Example?
Finally is keyword and final is also a keyword
it is executed  in every case even it gives exception but not if the
programme terminates(internsionally or unintensionally)
final keyword is used to not change the properties of the variable 
class or method
